# ESP-Homekit-NeoPixel

This Repo is based on the superb step by step tutorial by Achim Pieters (https://www.studiopieters.nl/esp-homekit-sdk-revised-installation/).
All credits belongs to him.
With his tutorial, I could build my own Homekt-NeoPixel files, based on https://www.studiopieters.nl/esp8266-homekit-neopixel-light-strip-ex/.
The number after the main is the number of leds in the strip.
